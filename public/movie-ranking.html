<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>It goes without saying why this movie is considered one of the best animated movies of all time. And if we're talking soundtracks?! Unforgettable! It's definitely a go-to Disney classic!</p>

<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>After watching this entire series, all I can say is Tom.Cruise. I mean, come on, he does his own stunts! If you're a fan of action movies, this series will not disappoint. Top-tier content.</p>

<h3>The Gardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>Marvel movies are already incredible, but The Guardians of the Galaxy takes the cake for me! Seriously, who doesn't just adore Groot?! All the vol. are cute, fun, and exciting –– <i>and they can even tug on your heartstrings a little bit.</i> Even if you're not a total fan of Marvel, these movies are a must-see!</p>
